              I joined the project soon after joining the company. The client dashboard already existed but required a complete redesign due to significant issues with data, design, and implementation. The project lacked a dedicated team or Project Manager, and the documentation was incomplete, so <strong>my initial focus was bringing clarity to the ambiguous state</strong>.

              During my time on the project, I collaborated closely with the Head of Design to gather business requirements and worked alongside another designer to research needs from other key leaders within the company. I also <strong>conducted interviews with the Operations team</strong>, who interacted with clients, to <strong>gather their feedback</strong> and <strong>identify pain points</strong> in the existing dashboard. Additionally, I <strong>collaborated with developers</strong> to understand the technical possibilities and limitations, ensuring that <strong>the design was feasible</strong> without over-complicating the implementation.
